In 2018 we saw the rise of pretraining and fine-tuning in natural language processing. Large neural networks have been trained on general tasks like language modelling and then fine-tuned for classification tasks. One of the latest milestones in this development is the release of BERT. BERT is a model that broke several records for how well models can handle language-based tasks. The model is based on a transformer architecture for “Attention is all you need”. They pre-trained it in a bidirectional way on several language modelling tasks. So probably the new slogan should read “Attention and pre-training is all you need”. If you want more details about the model and it’s pre-training, you find some resources at the end of this post.

his is a new post in my NER series. I will show you how you can fine-tune the Bert model to do state-of-the art n
